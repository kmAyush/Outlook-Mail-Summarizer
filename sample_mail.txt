Dear all,

I am excited to announce that there is a mini-scale Job Fair taking place at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) tomorrow. This event has been organized through the collaborative efforts of the IISc Students' Council and EntIISc, and we are excited to have you join us. Details of the event are as follows:



Date: 09th March, 2024 

Time: 9 AM - 5 PM 

Venue: J N Tata Auditorium Complex



This Job Fair has been initiated to address the gap in recruitment opportunities for IISc students. Our aim is to provide a platform where you can connect with potential employers and explore exciting career prospects firsthand. The event will feature six prominent startups from various sectors including Agri-Tech, Ed-Tech, Cybersecurity, and Energy. This presents an excellent opportunity for you to expand your professional network and gain valuable insights into the latest developments in these fields.



Furthermore, these startups are eager to offer internships, part-time, and full-time roles to IISc students.



Your attendance and feedback at this event will be invaluable as we plan larger-scale Job Fairs in the future. We encourage you to join us and share your thoughts to help us improve and tailor future events to better meet the needs of our student community.



We look forward to seeing you at the Job Fair tomorrow.


Best,
Camellia Bose,
Secretary, Academic Affairs,
Students' Council, IISc.
